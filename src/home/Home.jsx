        <h1>IN 2015, WORLD LEADERS AGREED TO 17 GLOBAL GOALS.</h1>
        <p>Seven years on, we have made progress, but there is still work to be done, and the Goals are more important than ever. The climate crisis. Ensuring no one goes hungry. Human rights abuses. Extreme poverty. Problems of this scale can be overwhelming, but the Global Goals(also known as the Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs) are the solution to tackling them.

        <p>The Global Goals are ambitious, but with great ambition we can achieve great things! To the small organisations advocating for girls to be educated, to the individuals turning plastic waste into something reusable and the businesses innovating to drive change, we see you. If we all take an active part in championing at least one Goal, our society will be better for all of us. What will your contribution be? Use our tool to share what your change advocating for and what’s on your World’s To-Do List.</p>
